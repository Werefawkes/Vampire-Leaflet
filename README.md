# London Shadows
[See the deployed website](https://vampire-leaflet.vercel.app/)

This is a website created to host a map and wiki for a Vampire: The Masquerade game that I am running for my friends.

It's made using Next.js, Tailwind, MongoDB, and Express. The backend repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/Werefawkes/Vampire-API)

It features a map made using Leaflet, and a wiki with full CRUD functionality.
